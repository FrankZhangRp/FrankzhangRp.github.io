abstract = {When deployed on a new domain different from the training set, deep learning often suffers from severe performance degradation. To combat domain shift, domain adaptation and domain generalization are proposed, where the former aims at transferring knowledge from related source domains to a known target domain, while the latter is more challenging by requiring the model to generalize to unknown target domains. This paper focuses on domain generalization and introduce a novel Fourier-based perspective for it. The main idea comes from the fact that Fourier amplitude component contains low-level statistics while phase component preserves high-level semantics. We thus propose a novel Fourier-based data augmentation strategy called AmpMix by linearly interpolating the amplitudes of two images while keeping their phases unchanged, to highlight the generalizable semantics contained in phase. To make full use of Fourier-augmented samples, we further incorporate consistency training between different augmentation views and devise a Fourier-based framework for three different domain generalization settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our Fourier-based method.}
